"""Command line entry point: ``python -m great_expectations``.

Great Expectations is a library, not a command line application, and this module is
deliberately the whole of its command surface: the one thing a user cannot do from
Python is put files into their own project before an agent reads them, because by then
the decision of what to trust in that project has already been made. Everything here
therefore only prints and installs -- it never touches data.

The subcommands wrap :mod:`great_expectations.agent_skills.installer`, which reports
per-skill problems rather than raising them. That shapes this envelope: a run that
installs three skills and refuses a fourth has to print all four and still exit
nonzero, so the whole outcome is visible in one screen and a script can tell it apart
from a clean run. The failures the installer *does* raise -- an unusable project
directory, a package that bundles no skills -- are answered with the message it wrote
and a nonzero exit, never a traceback: both are things the user can fix, and a
traceback would bury the sentence that says how.

    "Install the bundled skills into a project. Safe to run again at any time: skills "
    "already installed at this version are left byte-for-byte alone, and a directory "
    "that Great Expectations did not install, or that you have edited since it was "
    "installed, is reported rather than overwritten."
)

_LIST_DESCRIPTION: Final = (
    "Show the skills this package bundles and, for each agent directory, whether the "
    "skill is installed in the project and which version installed it."

#: Printed once below the failed destinations, whatever went wrong with them.
_FAILURE_FOOTER: Final = "Nothing was changed at the paths above."

#: Added when the run actually reported a skill as edited. The installer's reason for
#: that one says what to do; this says what "edited" means, because the answer has a
#: consequence nobody guesses: the whole directory is compared, so a file the user
#: never chose to put there counts. Its opening clause names the failures it belongs
#: to, since a run can report edited and unreadable destinations together and advice
#: meant for one would send the user hunting for the wrong thing at the other.
_LOCAL_EDIT_FOOTER: Final = (
    "Where a skill above is reported as edited: it counts as edited when anything "
