# Session preflight

Before configuring anything, establish what you're operating on: a project the
user already has on disk, or a temporary in-memory session. Do this exactly
once at the start of the flow, and tell the user the outcome before you do
anything else.

## Enter with `cloud_mode=False`

Call the context factory like this, not with a bare call:

```python executable
import great_expectations as gx

context = gx.get_context(cloud_mode=False)
```

A managed cloud offering that this factory can auto-connect to has been
retired. If a machine still carries leftover configuration for it (environment
variables, or a leftover config file), a bare `gx.get_context()` — and
`cloud_mode=True` — will detect that configuration, try to honor it, and raise
immediately with an error to that effect. That failure has nothing to do with
the user's local project or data; it's a stale-environment problem, and it
would happen before you ever got to look at a local project. Passing
`cloud_mode=False` explicitly skips that detection and always resolves to a
local file-backed project if one is found, or an in-memory session otherwise.

**Check for stale cloud configuration yourself before you call it**, because
`cloud_mode=False` silently discards that configuration rather than reporting
it — there is no signal in the return value or in normal output that it was
there. Look for `GX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `GX_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION_ID`, or
`GX_CLOUD_BASE_URL` in the environment. If any are set, tell the user plainly:
those variables were found but ignored, because that offering is no longer
reachable and today they should either unset them or ignore this message —
they have no effect on the session you're about to build.

## Interpret what comes back

`gx.get_context(cloud_mode=False)` returns one of two things. Branch on the
type:

```python executable
from great_expectations.data_context import FileDataContext

if isinstance(context, FileDataContext):
    context_root = context.root_directory
    # tell the user: "Using the existing project's configuration at
    # <context_root>."
else:
    # tell the user: "No project found — working in a temporary, in-memory
    # session. Nothing here is saved until it's written out to a project
    # (see write-out.md)."
    ...
```

<!-- consent-gate: project -->
**A discovered project is not optional to announce.** Always state
`context_root` back to the user before doing anything else, so they know
exactly which project they're about to modify — this also makes
`add_or_update_*` updates against that project legible rather than a surprise.
Name it precisely as the project's *configuration directory*, not "the
project" on its own — `context_root` is the `gx` subdirectory that holds
`great_expectations.yml` and the stores, and its **parent** is the project
directory a user would think of as "the project". That parent is what
`project_root_dir` means everywhere it's accepted (`preflight.md`'s own
one-liner below, and `write-out.md`'s `gx.get_context(mode="file",
project_root_dir=...)`). Never feed `context_root` back in as a
`project_root_dir` — doing so nests a second `gx` directory inside the first
(`<project>/gx/gx`) instead of reopening the same project.

**An in-memory (ephemeral) session is not a degraded mode to apologize for.**
It's a normal, fully supported way to work — state plainly that the session is
temporary and that everything can be written out to a real project later (see
`write-out.md`). Do not stop, and do not treat the absence of a project as an
error condition.

## Never scaffold a project yourself

<!-- consent-gate: project -->
Standing up a new file-backed project is the user's decision, not something
to do on their behalf or without being asked. Two things follow from this:

- Never call the file-context constructor without an explicit target
  directory. Concretely: never call `gx.get_context(mode="file")` with no
  `project_root_dir` — it does not raise or refuse when a project isn't found
  at that implicit location; it silently creates one, into the current
  working directory, with no confirmation. That is not something to do without
  the user asking for it.
- If a user wants a new project created rather than an in-memory session, give
  them the one-liner to run themselves and let them choose the location:

  ```python
  context = gx.get_context(mode="file", project_root_dir="<path>")
  ```

  Do not walk them through it interactively or pick the path for them.

`write-out.md` is the one procedure that does call `gx.get_context(mode="file",
...)`, and it is not an exception to this rule — it is this rule with its
condition met. What makes that call legitimate is not which document it appears
in; it is that the user agreed to the write-out and named the directory, in
their own messages, before it ran. Read the gate at the top of that document
before running any part of it. If those two things haven't happened yet, the
call is the same silent side effect it is here, and being inside the write-out
procedure does not make it something else.

## Never treat "no project" as a stop condition

An in-memory session is a supported, first-class outcome of preflight,
covered above. Do not stop, refuse, or ask the user to go create a project
first just because discovery didn't find one — proceed with the ephemeral
session instead.

## When discovery itself fails

Two failure shapes are worth knowing by name, because neither produces an
obvious, self-explanatory error, and both are easy to misread as "no project
found" when they're actually a misconfiguration worth surfacing:

**A stale `GX_HOME` environment variable.** If `GX_HOME` points at a directory
that either doesn't exist or doesn't contain a project config file, project
discovery does *not* raise — it silently falls back to the in-memory session,
exactly as if `GX_HOME` had never been set. If the user believes they have a
project and you get an in-memory session instead, this is the first thing to
check. Validate it yourself, since the factory won't:

```python executable
import os
from pathlib import Path

gx_home = os.environ.get("GX_HOME")
if gx_home is not None:
    gx_home_path = Path(gx_home).expanduser()
    if not (gx_home_path / "great_expectations.yml").is_file():
        # tell the user: "GX_HOME is set to <gx_home>, but no project config
        # was found there. If you expected an existing project to be used,
        # check the path — otherwise this variable can be ignored/unset."
        ...
```

**Stale cloud configuration**, covered above — check for it before calling
the factory, since the factory itself won't tell you it was there.

In both cases, the same shape of report applies: state what looked
misconfigured, state which value or file caused it, and give one concrete next
step (fix the path, unset the variable, or proceed with the in-memory
session). Never let a silent fallback pass as "everything's fine" when the
environment suggests the user expected otherwise.
